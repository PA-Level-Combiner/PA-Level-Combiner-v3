# PA Level Combiner v3
The 3rd edition of the PA Level Combiner.

A program that combines two levels of the same song into one.
Used to make collaborations easier by allowing collab members to work on their parts individually instead of passing files around.

Sometimes, parts of a level are split in different levels. This program combines those levels to get a level with all the parts in it.
